# Time Tracking Automation
An automated ETL pipeline to sync local productivity data with Google Sheets.

## Project Overview
This project was born out of a need to automate the tracking of my studying hours. Instead of manual logging, this system extracts data from the [Super Productivity app](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity), processes it using Linux command-line tools, and synchronizes it with a Google Spreadsheet via a custom API.

## Key Features

- Automated ETL: Extracts, transforms, and loads data without manual intervention.

- Self-Healing Logic: Uses a "Catch-up" mechanism to ensure data is synced even if the machine was powered off during the scheduled time.

- Reliability: Integrated with system startup using cron and @reboot triggers.

- Environment Safety: Uses .env files to keep API keys and sensitive URLs secure.

## Tech Stack
- Scripting: Bash (Shell Scripting)

- Data Parsing: jq (JSON processor), sed

- Calculation: bc (Arbitrary precision calculator)

- Network: curl

- Automation: Cron (Linux Task Scheduler)

- Backend: Google Apps Script (Web App)

## Architecture & Workflow
1. Extraction: The script reads raw JSON data from the sync-data.json file generated by the productivity app.

2. Transformation: 
    - Strips application-specific prefixes using sed.

    - Parses tasks and durations (milliseconds) using jq.

    - Converts milliseconds to hours using bc for floating-point accuracy.
3. Synchronization: 
    - check.sh verifies the last_success.log to see if a sync is required.

    - tracker.sh sends the formatted data to the Google Sheets API via curl.
